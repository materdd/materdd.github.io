title: Environmental DNA x Fishing
---

# Background
I love fishing and I can't catch a fish at all sometimes. At that time, I'm wondering i can see inside of water.

</p>

And I made a robot lure with a camera, but it can detect fishes only close to the camera. And cameras can't quantitatively estimate the number of fishes.

<p style="text-align:center;">
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/fishing_2.png" alt="" style="width: 300px;"/>{{ site.baseurl }}
</p>

But environmental DNA(eDNA) have a lot of potentials. eDNA fingerprinting can reveal which species of fish were recently swimming there with fishâ€™s skin, excreta and so on.
